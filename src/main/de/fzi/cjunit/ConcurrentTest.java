/**
 * The <code>ConcurrentTest</code> annotation tells cJUnit that the
 * <code>public void</code> method to which it is attached can be run as a
 * concurrent test case.  To check that the test method delivers the correct
 * results regardless of the scheduling of its threads, the test method is
 * executed in all possible thread interleavings.  Any exceptions thrown by
 * the test in any of the thread interleavings will be reported as failure.
 * If no exceptions are thrown in any thread interleavings, the test is
 * assumed to have succeeded.
 * <p>
 * The <code>ConcurrentTest</code> annotation supports one optional parameter.
 * <p>
 * The optional parameter <code>expected</code> declares that a test
 * method should throw an exception in all thread interleavings.  If it
 * doesn't throw an exception or if it throws a different exception than the
 * one declared in any of the thread interleavings, the test fails.
